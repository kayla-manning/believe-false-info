# Replication draft

### Overview of the original paper

Consider this as a part of the introduction to your report. Imagine the readers will only read your report--make sure they can follow your report without reading the original paper.

  - What questions did they ask?
  
  With the prevalence of claims of election fraud and Q-Anon conspiracy theories, it seems as if Republican voters exhibit a greater tendency to follow conspiracy theories. Does the prevalence of far-right conspiracy theories result from a greater supply of such rumors spread by political elite or a greater likelihood of believing false information? Previous research about the propensity to accept false information does not differentiate between supply-side and demand-side explanations. In the case of misinformation, *supply-side* explanations have to do with the effectiveness of political elites in spreading such information, and *demand-side* explanations involve the likelihood of citizens believing false information upon receipt. This study focuses on the demand side and examines if Republicans or Democrats believe false political information at different rates.
  
  - What analysis did they run?
  
  The original researchers conducted a carefully designed experiment to reveal any asymmetries in the proclivity of citizens to endorse false political information. The experiment utilized a probability-based, representative sample of Americans via the National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel. Participants reported their partisanship prior to the experiment. Researchers presented the following questions in a random order:
  
  + Ohio[^state-choice] item: Did [Party] legislators in Ohio accept laundered money from a group of Canadian Steel
manufacturers, hoping to improve their business dealings in the state? 
  + Wisconsin[^state-choice] item: Did Lucas Hofmann, a [Party] prosecutor in Wisconsin, plot with [same party] Party
members to suppress evidence that Gerry Mason, a wealthy donor in the state, engaged in pedophilia?
  + Oil item: Was the price of crude oil higher on March 1, 2016 than on October 1, 2016? 
  
Researchers gave respondents five response options, scaled from $0 = \text{definitely did not occur}$ to $1 = \text{definitely occurred}$. The Oil item served as a baseline to assess individuals' proclivity to agree with an apolitical survey item. Researchers randomly assigned a political party for the Ohio item and used the opposite political party in the Wisconsin item. To track if a rumor is consistent with the respondent's party identification, researchers crafted a *Consistency* variable to indicate if the rumor is consistent with the participant's party identification.

Using the results of this experiment, the study authors examined the relationship between rumor endorsement and a respondent's partisanship, rumor consistency, and the interaction between the two variables using a simple OLS regression. This interaction term examines the crux of the research question: is either party more responsive to consistency pressures?
  
  - What did they conclude?
  
  Ultimately, the researchers did not find evidence that citizens of either party exhibit a greater tendency to endorse false political information. This runs contrary to previous work in the field [source] and supports the conclusion that partisan asymmetries in conspiracy theories largely owe themselves to a greater *supply* of false information rather than a greater *demand*.


### A few paragraphs walking through what you did for the replication, along with the results (figures/tables) you have reproduced:
(Replicate all results--or all important results--from the paper. Provide a clear statement about which aspects of the paper you were able to replicate and which parts, if any, you were not able to replicate)

### A (proposed) extension of the paper

  - Did you find anything that you think could go beyond the scope of the original paper? Extensions may be big or small.
  
  - Using different methods, models, or specific presentations of the results (e.g. using different methods, changing model specifications, verifying the robustness or sensitivity of the model, creating better looking and more informative tables/figures, etc.)
  
  - May also discuss some proposed extensions involving more data collection, development of a new method, a potential follow-up study, etc.

[^state-choice]: Researchers specifically chose the notable swing states of Ohio and Wisconsin as the states of focus since politicians could be either Republican or Democrat.
