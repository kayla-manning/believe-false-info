This study assesses the inclination of voters from each political party to endorse false, damaging information about political opponents, ultimately finding no evidence that either side has a greater proclivity to endorse false political information. In an experiment, researchers randomized the partisanship of originally crafted rumors to remove potential biases. The main analysis uses OLS regression to measure the relationship between rumor endorsement and the respondents' partisanship. In a supplemental regression, the researchers include interaction terms to assess potential asymmetries between respondentsâ€™ party identification and the party addressed by the rumor. In addition, the analysis includes a sensitivity analysis that compares models with and without voters identifying as independents.
